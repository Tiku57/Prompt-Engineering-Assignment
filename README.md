## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a fully responsive, single-page landing page for a fictional digital agency named "NexusStream." 

It was created to demonstrate **Prompt Engineering** capabilities for a Front-End Development Intern role. The entire codebase (HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript) was generated using specific, structural AI prompts without manual code editing.

### 🎯 Assignment Goals
1.  **Prompt Quality:** Writing reusable, detailed meta-prompts and section-specific instructions.
2.  **Design Output:** Generating a clean, modern, and responsive UI.
3.  **Code Quality:** Ensuring semantic HTML and functional Tailwind utility classes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** HTML5 (Semantic Structure)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
* **Interactivity:** Vanilla JavaScript (Mobile Menu Toggle)
* **Fonts:** Inter (Google Fonts)
* **Icons:** Inline SVGs (Heroicons style - no external libraries)
* **Images:** Unsplash (via direct URL parameters)

## 🧩 Features
The page consists of five distinct, responsive sections generated via modular prompts:

1.  **Navigation Bar:** Sticky positioning, backdrop blur, and a functional mobile hamburger menu.
2.  **Hero Section:** Split-screen layout (desktop) and stacked layout (mobile) with high-quality imagery.
3.  **Services Section:** A 3-column responsive grid with hover effects and inline SVG icons.
4.  **Contact Form:** Clean UI with focus states and semantic form fields.
5.  **Footer:** Multi-column layout with social links and copyright info.

## 🤖 Prompt Engineering Strategy
Instead of a single "do it all" prompt, I utilized a **Modular Meta-Prompt Strategy**:

1.  **The Meta-Prompt:** Established the persona (Senior Front-End Dev), the design system (Slate-900 & Blue-600), and technical constraints (Inline SVGs, Mobile-First).
2.  **Chained Prompts:** Each section was generated individually using the context established in the meta-prompt to ensure visual consistency.

**Key Constraints Applied:**
* *Restricted external icon libraries* to prevent broken links.
* *Enforced specific Unsplash URL parameters* (`fit=crop`) to maintain aspect ratios.
* *Mandated `w-full` and `grid-cols-1` defaults* to guarantee mobile responsiveness.
